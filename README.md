# Movie Recommendation App

A machine learning movie recommendation application that allows users to search a movie and find various related movies that they may like to watch. This is done by training the model with movie and movie rating data. The algorithm for this is essentailly to first find recommendations from users similar to the user who searched, narrow down the amount of similar users for more precision, get movies from similar users that are truly similar to the searched movie, and then obtain a score percentage that determines the top related movie recommendations. The better the score, the better the recommendation.

This application was made in the programming language python.
